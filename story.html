            <h1>Our Story ‚òïüíë</h1>
            <p>Cafetana was born from the dreams of a passionate couple who aspired to open their own coffee shop. Driven by a shared love for coffee, community, and culture, we initially envisioned creating a cozy caf√© in the hearts of Chicanos everywhere. However, our journey took an unexpected but exciting turn.</p>
            <p>Everywhere we went, whether at family gatherings, at work, or in casual conversations, the playful term "T√≥xica" always came up. It was a humorous yet powerful reminder of our Latino roots and cultural expressions.</p>
            <img src="picture/founders.jpg" alt="Founders" class="founders-section-image">
            <p>Although our coffee dream remains alive, we discovered a passion in creating apparel that lets people embrace their individuality, humor, and culture. The T√≥xica collection was born out of the belief that everyone deserves to express themselves boldly and proudly.</p>
            <p>Today, Cafetana stands as more than just a brand. It's a statement, a vibe, and a community. Wear your personality proudly‚Äîwhether you're a little T√≥xica, or just celebrating life with style!</p>
